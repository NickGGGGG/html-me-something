            <h1 id="works">Kansas City Trip!</h1>
            <p>So this is my girlfriend and I first trip out of town
                alone. We have been on one out of town trip before,
                 and that was camping with her family. We are both 19
                 so finding a hotel was a little bit tricky, because
                 most hotels you have to be 21 to check in:/ but luckly
                 the <span class="em">Hotel-Motel-Holiday-Inn</span> is not like that.
                 You only have to be 18 to check in. We choose Kansas City,
                 beacuse we're both 19, in school, with part time jobs, so
                 we we're <span id="budget">ballin a budget</span>! Kansas city is not 
                 to expensive and we went to the <a href = "https://countryclubplaza.com">Country Club Plaza</a> which is a 
                 lot of fun!

                    <h2 class="hometown">The Train</h2>
                    <p>We deicided to take a train there, because neither of 
                        us wanted to drive and I have never been on a train
                        before. We took the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home?cmp=pdsrch-Amtrak%7CAmtrak+KW-google&gclid=CjwKCAjwhcjVBRBHEiwAoDe5x9YMKq2ZBPS_z2k8BQ9QYo4mRam-ja8W0UOZCCy04zrrS4zm0DC-gxoCbjEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Amtrak</a>
                        from Washington to Union Station. Union Station gives you a  
                         <span class="em">old timey</span> train station vibe, which is really cool.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="hometown">Arriving to Kansas City</h2>
                    <p>As we arrived to Kansas city we got picked by a shuttle bus,
                        courtesy of the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/reservation?qAdlt=1&qBrs=6c.hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.ul.vn.ki.sp.nd.ct&qChld=0&qFRA=1&qGRM=0&qIta=99629062&qPSt=0&qRRSrt=rt&qRef=df&qRms=1&qRpn=1&qRpp=20&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qSrt=sBR&qWch=0&srb_u=1&icdv=99629062&cid=35562&dp=true&glat=SEAR&setPMCookies=true"><em>Hotel-Motel-Holiday-Inn</em></a>
                        . The shuttle was able to take us anywhere around the hotel 
                        and luckly are hotel was close to Union Station and walking 
                        distance from the plaza. When we got checked in it our hotel, 
                        we dropped our bags off and made dinner reservation, but we 
                        still had an hour or two before then so we walked around the
                        plaza. It was beauiful, the weather was a little windy on the 
                        first day, but still sunny.

                    <h2 class="hometown">FOOD</h2>
                    <p>Being a human requires you to eat to survive, luckly my girlfriend
                        and I love food, <span class="bold">especically sushi</span>. There was
                        only one day that we didn't get sushi during our trip. At our hotel we got a 
                        free buffet breakfast. The best option at 
                        the buffet were the potato bites, They had some really seasoning.
                        Besides breakfast and one night of room service, we ate at restruants
                        in the Plaza and all of them were <span class="bold">delicious</span>!
